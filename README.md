# isthisarealjob-API
 This is a project that can be used in verifying job invitations either as real or as fake. 
 
## How it Works
- The company sentiment analysis scrapes through nairaland comments and runs an analysis on what people are saying about the company.
- The address verifier makes use of google's Geocoding API in verifying address.
- The invitation text checker checks for grammatical errors in the invitation sent by the company.
- Then a confidence checker returns a result thats between `Fake` and `Real` on a scale of 0-10.
